They serve as governing bodies that oversee and manage various trades and professions, from Fighters to Mages, from Workers to Servants. Each guild holds a significant amount of power, as they compete for the support and favor of landowners and work towards gaining dominance over one another.

Guilds often have their own set of rules that members must adhere to, in order to maintain good standing within their respective guild. These rules vary between different guilds but typically revolve around fair conduct in business dealings, respect for other guild members, and loyalty towards the guild's common goals.

As guilds continue to strive for success and dominance in Aliron, conflicts can arise when opposing interests clash. However, despite these rivalries it's important to note that when faced with danger or threats towards the safety of citizens or stability of the kingdom itself, these powerful organizations stand united against any outside forces aiming to cause harm.""",

They are usually chosen from among the most prominent members of their guild, and have proven themselves capable in both their trade and leadership abilities.

The title of Guild Leader is not only one of honor but also carries with it a heavy burden. These individuals are tasked with managing all aspects of their guild, from resolving internal disputes to establishing alliances with other factions or negotiating contracts with landowners.

Guild Leaders have a reputation for being fierce negotiators, skilled tacticians, and wise rulers. It is said that nothing happens in the capital city without the involvement or approval of at least one Guild Leader. However, despite holding such great power they are still accountable to their members, who can remove them from office should they fail to fulfill their duties as leader.""",

	LOADLORE3 = """The Mad King, whose name is now feared and whispered amongst the people of Aliron, was once the ruler of the kingdom but was eventually overthrown by the guilds. The Mad King's reign was characterized by his unpredictable behavior and madness which led those around him to fear for their lives.

Over the 20 years of his reign, there were rumors that he had set fire to entire communities in fits of rage or ordered for executions without trial. He became widely despised among both commoners and nobles alike due to his frequent outbursts and unprovoked acts of violence.

As discontent with King's rule grew among citizens and even landowners who felt threatened by his unpredictable ways, at that point the four major guilds have united to stop his rule and abdicate the monarchy. It was believed there were no descendants of him surviving until recently...""",

	LOADLORE4 = """Among the many races that populate the world are the Beastkin and Halfkin. Beastkin are humanoid beings with thick fur covering their body, resembling various animals, while Halfkin only possess animal-like features in their ears and tails.

Beastkin are known to exist primarily in tribes outside of urban areas, valuing community and harmony over individualism. They lead a nomadic way of life, often following herds of wild prey and engaging in shamanistic rituals praising local beings. Often viewed as primal or 'less civilized' by other races due to their simpler way of living compared to society within the kingdom's borders.

Halfkins, on the other hand, are descendants born from a union between Beastkins and other races, primarily humans, therefore more they are considerably more common at large cities. 

In Aliron, however, all races coexist peacefully for the most part, though prejudice is common. Despite these challenges both Beastkins and Halfkins have attained various positions of power within guilds and across the kingdom.""",

This, coupled with their wings and natural magic abilities, makes them an enchanting sight to behold. They live primarily in areas of rich magic, such as dense forests or near ancient ruins.

Fairies are characterized by their childlike behavior and curious nature. They possess innocent personalities that often endear them to others but also lead to naivety when dealing with more harsh aspects of reality. 

However, this playful demeanor is accompanied by an extreme sexual drive which Fairies express with little reserve or shame. This makes them one of the most attractive and rare trained slaves among many.""",

	LOADLORE6 = """Gods play an important and influential role in the lives of mortals. These divine entities are worshiped for their power and wisdom, with each God having specific domains they preside over.

To help carry out their wishes within the mortal realm, certain rare individuals are chosen as Champions by these various deities. These Champions are granted exceptional abilities above that of ordinary people in order to carry out tasks most believe impossible or beyond comprehension.

Champions can come from any race or background and may be granted powers ranging from control of elements/magic to physical prowess beyond human limits, often referred to as 'divine blessings'. They're usually called upon directly by their patron god through visions or divinations. This divine guidance is absolute but not without costs for continuous service deed.

There's no shortage of myths surrounding these individuals. Often spoken highly because they've been Champions for various causes throughout history - both good and bad - either punished or rewarded accordingly depending on how well they fulfill divine instructions.""",

	LOADLORE7 = """Landowners in Aliron hold a considerable deal of wealth and social status within the kingdom. This is due to their ownership of large swaths of land that are used to cultivate crops, mine for resources, or build on in various ways.

In order to maintain these properties in an efficient manner, Landowners frequently use slaves. These slaves are often treated poorly and viewed as little more than property by those who own them, their freedom denied on account of their servitude.

Despite working under harsh conditions beyond human endurance long hours with minimal rest, they are considered indispensable in keeping the economy running smoothly. Their work productivity allowed control over market prices and competing guilds.

However, while it might seem that Landowners have nothing but contempt for those below them, there have been cases where some have shown unexpected kindness towards their slaves depending on rare compassionate nature or personal beliefs systems not common among majority owner population.""",

Aire's heart had begun pounding and her body grew unbearably sensitive. Amelia idly fondled her trussed breasts and periodically pinched her nipples, eliciting jerks and squeals from the elf that gradually became shudders and moans.

Amelia's tail had made it's way to Aire's panty clad sex and twitched from side to side, stimulating her now swollen clit through the material. She just couldn't think.

She pooled all of her will into one last attempt to twist away, but Amelia held her in place thrusting two fingers inside her and using her pussy as a handhold.

Amelia snaked her long tail back up Aire's leg, wriggling it back and forth, finally working it into her drooling honeypot. Aire moaned and bucked futilely against Amelia's hips on pure carnal instinct, but Amelia delivered a slow deliberate pace. Aire inhaled and just as she was about to cum, Amelia began thrusting into her without as much force as a man might have but much faster.

The sudden stimulation was overwhelming in the poor elf's hypersensitive state. She clenched and shook so wildly she stopped breathing and her eyes rolled back. One orgasm overlapped with another over minutes as Amelia pistoned her tail into the young elf until she blacked out.

Amelia lowered the spasming girl to the floor gently and retrieved her satchel after cleaning off.

{color=yellow|Amelia: — Oh, [Master], there you are. I- I've been such a bad girl. I should be punished.}

Amelia's feline eyes are wide and she is flushed with desire, her long tail whipping side to side. 

You cross the room and grab a handful of hair, yanking her head back. A smile crosses her pretty face as she moans at your sudden forcefulness. Your other hand reaches around behind her to grab an ass-cheek, squeezing it hard enough to hurt.

You grab a coil of fine silk rope and tow Amelia into the centre of the room. Pulling the harness down, you slip its leather loops over her upper body. Amelia begins to pant in uncontrollable arousal as you bind her. 

You lash rope around her midriff, running it tight around each of her heaving breasts, and then around her collarbone, pinning her arms to her sides. Hauling on the pulley jerks Amelia upright. 

You grab her calf and lift one leg, bending it until the knee almost touches her face. You tie it in place, strapping the foot tight against her buttock. She whimpers excitedly as you stand back to admire your ropework.""",

You fondle her vulnerable body, kneading her breasts and pinching the soft flesh of her ass. Your shaft grinds against wet pussy-lips and Amelia keens needily. You take hold, one hand grabbing a tit, one gripping her hair, and slowly enter her slick pussy. She tries to twitch her hips to urge you deeper but she can hardly move. 

As your thick cock penetrates deep, Amelia sighs in ecstasy. Her eyes roll back and her tight cunt convulses around you.

Once her screams subside, you grab her narrow waist with both hands so you can fuck her harder. Both your bodies are covered in a fine sheen of sweat. Amelia is panting loud as your penis rams violently into her pussy. You feel your orgasm approaching fast.

You cup her leaking cunt and smear a handful of cum into her face and hair. You untie her raised leg so she stands on both feet, then loosen the ropes and remove the harness. She sways unsteadily, still handcuffed, her thighs parted to ease the soreness in her tender pussy. You sit on the armchair and pull her over your knee.
