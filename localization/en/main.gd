Guilds often have their own set of rules that members must adhere to, in order to maintain good standing within their respective guild. These rules vary between different guilds but typically revolve around fair conduct in business dealings, respect for other guild members, and loyalty towards the guild's common goals.

As guilds continue to strive for success and dominance in Aliron, conflicts can arise when opposing interests clash.

The title of Guild Leader is not only one of honor but also carries with it a heavy burden. These individuals are tasked with managing all aspects of their guild, from resolving internal disputes to establishing alliances with other factions or negotiating contracts with landowners.

Guild Leaders have a reputation for being fierce negotiators, skilled tacticians, and wise rulers. It is said that nothing happens in the capital city without the involvement or approval of at least one Guild Leader. However, despite holding such great power they are still accountable to their members, who can remove them from office should they fail to fulfill their duties as leader.""",

Over the 20 years of his reign, there were rumors that he had set fire to entire communities in fits of rage or ordered for executions without trial. He became widely despised among both commoners and nobles alike due to his frequent outbursts and unprovoked acts of violence.

As discontent with King's rule grew among citizens and even landowners who felt threatened by his unpredictable ways, at that point the four major guilds have united to stop his rule and abdicate the monarchy. It was believed there were no descendants of him surviving until recently...""",

They lead a nomadic way of life, often following herds of wild prey and engaging in shamanistic rituals praising local beings. Often viewed as primal or 'less civilized' by other races due to their simpler way of living compared to society within the kingdom's borders.

Halfkins, on the other hand, are descendants born from a union between Beastkins and other races, primarily humans, therefore more they are considerably more common at large cities. 

In Aliron, however, all races coexist peacefully for the most part, though prejudice is common. Despite these challenges both Beastkins and Halfkins have attained various positions of power within guilds and across the kingdom.""",

Fairies are characterized by their childlike behavior and curious nature. They possess innocent personalities that often endear them to others but also lead to naivety when dealing with more harsh aspects of reality.

To help carry out their wishes within the mortal realm, certain rare individuals are chosen as Champions by these various deities. These Champions are granted exceptional abilities above that of ordinary people in order to carry out tasks most believe impossible or beyond comprehension.

Champions can come from any race or background and may be granted powers ranging from control of elements/magic to physical prowess beyond human limits, often referred to as 'divine blessings'. They're usually called upon directly by their patron god through visions or divinations. This divine guidance is absolute but not without costs for continuous service deed.

There's no shortage of myths surrounding these individuals. Often spoken highly because they've been Champions for various causes throughout history - both good and bad - either punished or rewarded accordingly depending on how well they fulfill divine instructions.""",

Despite working under harsh conditions beyond human endurance long hours with minimal rest, they are considered indispensable in keeping the economy running smoothly. Their work productivity allowed control over market prices and competing guilds.

However, while it might seem that Landowners have nothing but contempt for those below them, there have been cases where some have shown unexpected kindness towards their slaves depending on rare compassionate nature or personal beliefs systems not common among majority owner population.""",

Amelia retrieved a small flask of honey colored liquid which she upended against a handkerchief for a moment before stoppering it. Aire stood to her feet to struggle as best she could rather than be poisoned, but none of her training was of any use bound as she was.

Aire held her breath for over a minute.

Aire's heart had begun pounding and her body grew unbearably sensitive. Amelia idly fondled her trussed breasts and periodically pinched her nipples, eliciting jerks and squeals from the elf that gradually became shudders and moans.

{color=aqua|Amelia: — I see your voice has become more excited. Why won't you tell us what we want to know? To continue resisting like this... you must be quite fond of your master? Perhaps, even share a more intimate bond?}""",

Amelia squeezed her breasts against Aire, leaning against her in such a way that Aire would fall unless she widened her stance and arched her back. Amelia's soft finely furred tail felt like it was made of pins and needles as it slid along Aire's leg slowly upward.

{color=aqua|Amelia: — Ah, another innocent elf maiden! I almost miss training the newcomers personally.}

Amelia's tail had made it's way to Aire's panty clad sex and twitched from side to side, stimulating her now swollen clit through the material. She just couldn't think.

Aire's eyes teared up with humiliation as she couldn't fight the overwhelming pleasure anymore.

Amelia slid a hand down from Aire's chest to pull her panties to the side, and gently traced her fingers up and down her slick slit. Under the influence of the intense aphrodisiac Aire's hips thrusted at the digits without and against her conscious thought.

She pooled all of her will into one last attempt to twist away, but Amelia held her in place thrusting two fingers inside her and using her pussy as a handhold. Aire melted and began to tremble violently, but Amelia slipped her fingers back out and resumed teasing Aire's slit, keeping her on the edge.

{color=aqua|Amelia: — One word and you'll get what you want.}

Aire turned her head and whispered. Amelia's ear twitched as the elf breathed heavily into it and she beamed.

{color=aqua|Amelia: — Good girl. Now, here's your reward.}

Amelia snaked her long tail back up Aire's leg, wriggling it back and forth, finally working it into her drooling honeypot. Aire moaned and bucked futilely against Amelia's hips on pure carnal instinct, but Amelia delivered a slow deliberate pace. Aire inhaled and just as she was about to cum, Amelia began thrusting into her without as much force as a man might have but much faster.

The sudden stimulation was overwhelming in the poor elf's hypersensitive state. She clenched and shook so wildly she stopped breathing and her eyes rolled back. One orgasm overlapped with another over minutes as Amelia pistoned her tail into the young elf until she blacked out.

Amelia lowered the spasming girl to the floor gently and retrieved her satchel after cleaning off.

{color=aqua|Amelia: — See, was that so hard? Hope we'll meet again in better circumstances.}
